## Requirements:

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.

Want some support on the challenge? Join our Slack community and ask questions in the help channel.

## Getting started
``` Set up the project with version control (e.g. Git)

Read the README.md file and have a look around the project

Get colors, fonts etc from the style-guide.md file
 
Set up your project/file architecture however you want ```

Start coding!

Summary: 

I did it to refresh layout changes concepts, reutilization, the challenge was without framework but I really needed to create with React *-*.
